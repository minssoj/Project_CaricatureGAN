## Updates

## Abstract
In this paper, we construct a database for converting portraits into caricatures and propose the method which converts portraits into caricatures using Cycle-GAN. First, in this paper, we use the unpaired image data set, and database for converting portraits into caricatures consist of portraits and caricature images collected online. Next, we develop the network for converting portraits into caricatures based on Cycle-GAN. Through the experimental results, it was confirmed that the superiority of the proposed method.
